;I think that the original implementation of i-like-more? defined inside the make-person is quite complex
;and it also causes errors during the runtime. Because of that I have commented out the provided i-like-more?
;and wrote mine instead:
(define (i-like-more? person1 person2)
  (lambda (list) (> (length (memq person1 list)) (length (memq person2 list)))))
;I am aware than racket has inbuilt 'memq', but it hough it would be better for my learning process to actually write it out,
;I have used book pages 194-196 to write this -->
(define (memq item x) (cond ((null? x) false)
((eq? item (car x)) x) (else (memq item (cdr x)))))
;The assignment sheet says that we have to be vary of defining this procedure in corect context in order to
;have access to proper data structures. However, I noticed that i-like-more? is used/called only once in this
;code, and the prefereence list that we need is passed as a parameter such that ((i-like-more? person current-intended) preference-list),
;so the position of this procedure can be arbitrary as we are already provided with the data structure.

;The above implementation of i-like-more? assumes that the preference list applied to lambda is not empty.

;Results lead me to believe that the order of marriage proposal matters; the proposer, in this case, gets their priority.
;So, in this small case, the group that proposes first gets what they want/ gets who they like more.
;And if itâ€™s true, I would rather propose marriage myself than have it proposed to me.
